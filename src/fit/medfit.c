/*
	<medfit.c> -- Code to perform median line fitting.
	24aug92 jm  Original code modified from Numerical Recipes.
	16sep92 jm  Modified to permit assignment of fit to
		    individual user variables.
	26jul93 jm  Added Gaussian fit.
	09aug93 jm  Removed sscan calls in favor of wipisnumber().
	29aug94 jm  Removed conditional in gaussfit() that would cause
		    an infinite loop whenever the output was re-entered
		    as input.  Also fixed bug in wipfit() that forces
		    the amplitude to always be fit (it was chosing the
		    width and not the amplitude).
	27sep95 jm  Permitted zero value to be fit in gaussfit().
        19jun96 jm  Split the fit code off into it's own individual
		    directory and split the different types of fits
		    into individual routines.

  NOTE:  This code was originally extracted from the Fortran version of
  Numerical Recipes by Press, et. al. and has been modified and updated
  to be used within WIP.  There are substantial enough differences in
  this code from the code that now appears in the newer versions of the
  Press book that the user should make no assumptions about the
  transportable nature of this code.  The bulk of the code in this file
  belongs to the authors of Numerical Recipes and should not be extracted.
  In other words, get your own book!

this works:
wip test.wip -e wipcmd  arg1

but this doesn't seem to be able to enter a command argument with whitespace
wip test.wip -e wipcmd  "arg1a arg1b"

pretty serious bug when images have masks. It works on either solaris
(the old code) or linux (the new current code)....


Some items for the future:
--------------------------

1) wip uses homebrewn routines to read miriad and fits files. these have proven
   to be fragile and the cause of numerous problems. they should ideally by default
   be using the miriad and cfitsio library (though a fallback would be nice to have).

2) pyWIP: python-to-wip interface. there are already some python pgplot interfaces.
  

3) allow via the commandline to set arbitrary key=val pairs, which then get
   flagged and interpreted in the code when these variables are encounteres.
   This way one can provide template wip (.twip?) files then can be reused,
   e.g.
	data $file
	xcol $xcol
	xcol $ycol
	...

	wip -d /xs file=aaa.dat xcol=1 ycol=3

4) code has IEEEByteSwap wipdefs.h, its detection is not very good and based on OS, not CPU
